learnpython.py 
-is based off the tutorial provided by the nice folks of PRAW. 

reddiv_error.py 
-should look through the first ten posts of reddit_div sub and write the submissions to a text file as well display the results in your terminal. A explanation on the write to a file and print. I created a new reddit account and it doesn't have any karma, so the captcha error would keep appearing and it wasn't fun. After many attempts and much research I found the easiest way to is just attain karma. I did not want to do that, so I thought of another way that could be considered just as good or better.   

hurr_matt.py 
Almost the same as reddiv_error. Gives you submissions about Hurricane Matthew that is related to South Carolina. Looks through the Hurricane Matthew Subreddit.
